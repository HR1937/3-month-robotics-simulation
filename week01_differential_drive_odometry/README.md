# Week 1 – Differential Drive Kinematics & Odometry

**Status:**  Completed (theory + basic simulation + plotting)

This week I learned how a **2-wheel differential drive robot** moves and how to estimate its pose `(x, y, θ)` over time using wheel encoders and odometry. All work here is done in simulation.

---

## What I implemented

- Robot pose: `x, y, θ` in a world frame.
- Kinematics:
  - Linear velocity: `v = (Vr + Vl) / 2`
  - Angular velocity: `ω = (Vr − Vl) / L`
- Odometry update:
  - `x_new = x_old + v · cos(θ) · dt`
  - `y_new = y_old + v · sin(θ) · dt`
  - `θ_new = θ_old + ω · dt`
- Encoder-based simulation:
  - Fake ticks from commanded wheel speeds.
  - Recovered `Vl`, `Vr` from ticks (like a real robot).
- Motion tests:
  - Straight line (Vr = Vl)
  - Curved / circular motion (Vr > Vl)
  - Rotation in place (Vr = −Vl)
- Path logging to CSV and plotting to `week1_path_plot.png`.

## How to Run

From inside `week01_differential_drive_odometry/src/`:

### 1. Build and run C++ simulation

```bash
g++ -o odometry_sim main.cpp kinematics.cpp
./odometry_sim
```

Generates:

* `Straight_path.csv`
* `Circular_path.csv`
* `Rotated_path.csv`
> The CSV files are generated by main.cpp and overwritten on each run.
### 2. Plot the paths (Python)

```bash
python graph-plot.py
```

This:

* reads the CSV files
* creates one figure with:
  * left: XY paths,
  * right: θ vs step (rotation test)
* saves `week1_path_plot.png`.

---

## Outcome

Week 1 gave me:

* an intuitive grip on differential drive motion, and
* a full mini-pipeline: wheel speeds → encoders → pose → plotted path.

(Full derivations and explanations are in `notes.md`.)
