# 3-Month Robotics Simulation (WIP)

This repository documents my 90-day self-learning journey in **mobile robotics**, using **simulation only** (no hardware yet).  
Right now I am working on **Week 1**.

---

## Current Status

- 🟩 Week 1 – Differential drive kinematics & odometry — IN PROGRESS  
- ⬜ Week 2 – PID control simulation  
- ⬜ Week 3 – ROS2 basics (pub/sub, service)  
- ⬜ Week 4 – URDF + TF  
- ⬜ Month 2 – Gazebo + perception  
- ⬜ Month 3 – SLAM + autonomous navigation  

(Checked weeks will be marked as completed as I progress.)

---

## Goal of this project

By the end of the 90 days, I aim to:

- understand robot motion & control  
- build simulations in Gazebo  
- develop ROS2 nodes and services  
- process camera & LiDAR data  
- run SLAM & Nav2 navigation  
- produce a final demo of a robot navigating a virtual environment autonomously

## Repository Structure (will expand weekly)
```text
3-month-robotics-simulation/
│
├─ week01_differential_drive_odometry/   → odometry & differential drive simulation
│   ├─ README.md
│   ├─ notes.md
│   └─ src/
│
├─ week02_pid_control/                   → PID speed control & tuning
├─ week03_ros2_basics/                   → ROS2 topics, nodes, services
├─ week04_urdf_tf/                       → robot model & TF transforms
└─ ...

```

Each week has its own folder, containing:

- `notes.md` — theory & explanations  
- `src/` — source code  
- `plots/` — generated graphs/images (if any)

## How to follow along

This is mainly for my learning, but if anyone wants to follow:

1. Start with `week01_differential_drive_odometry/notes.md`
2. Run the Week-1 code in `src/` (once committed)
3. Continue week-by-week as the repo grows

---

## Important note

This is a **learning-in-public** project.  
The repo will grow gradually.  
Some weeks will have detailed code; some will start with just theory.  
That’s intentional.

---

## Final objective

At the end of Month 3 (Day 90), I will:

- record a simulation demo  
- summarize learnings  
- update README with final outcomes  
- make a portfolio-ready robotics showcase

May Shree_Krsna bless this journey 🙏
